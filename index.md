#### Welcome to Adam Frost's lab at the University of California, San Francisco

##### Work in our lab is connected by a common vision: to see the cell's macromolecules *get together and come to life*. We study the molecular machines that are too fragile to purify to homogeneity, too large or too flexible to crystallize, or that depend upon lipids that are irreplaceable by detergent micelles. To derive unique insights into cell biology and human disease, we integrate atomic structure determination by cryo-EM with genetics, biochemistry, and diverse imaging techniques. We belong to the department of **[Biochemistry and Biophysics](http://biochemistry.ucsf.edu/)** and the **[Macromolecular Structure Group](http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/)** within **[UCSF](http://www.ucsf.edu/)**.
