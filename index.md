#### Welcome to the Frost lab of the **[University of California, San Francisco](http://www.ucsf.edu/)**

##### Our work is connected by a common vision: to see macromolecules *get together and come to life*. We study biological machines that are too fragile to purify, too large or too flexible to crystallize, or that depend on lipids for their form and function. To derive unique insights into cell biology and human disease, we integrate atomic structure determination by cryoEM with genetics, biochemistry, and diverse imaging techniques. We work within the department of **[Biochemistry and Biophysics](http://biochemistry.ucsf.edu/)** and the **[Macromolecular Structure Group](http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/)**.
