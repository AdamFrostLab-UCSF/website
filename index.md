#### Welcome to Adam Frost's laboratory at the University of California, San Francisco

##### Work in our lab is connected by a common vision: to see the cell's macromolecules *get together and come to life*. We study the molecular machines that are too fragile to purify to homogeneity, too large or too flexible to crystallize, or that depend upon lipids that are irreplaceable by detergent micelles. In order to make unique contributions to cell biology, we integrate structure determination by cryo-EM with genetic, biochemical, and diverse imaging methods. We belong to the **[department of Biochemistry and Biophysics](http://biochemistry.ucsf.edu/)** and the **[Macromolecular Structure Group](http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/)** within **[UCSF](http://www.ucsf.edu/)**.
