#### Welcome to the Frost lab of the **[University of California, San Francisco](http://www.ucsf.edu/)**

##### Our lab strives to see how macromolecules *get together and come to life*. We seek to understand how fuel-driven biological machines work--especially those that are too fragile to purify, too dynamic or too flexible to crystallize, or that depend on lipids for their form and function. To derive unique insights into cell biology and human disease, we integrate atomic structure determination by cryoEM with genetics, biochemistry, and other imaging techniques. We work within the department of **[Biochemistry and Biophysics](http://biochemistry.ucsf.edu/)** the **[Macromolecular Structure Group](http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/)** and the **[Quantitative Biosciences Institute](https://qbi.ucsf.edu/)**. The banner art is a mesoscale model of living matter, partly inspired by our work, by **[Said Sannuga](http://www.cellscape.co.uk)**.
