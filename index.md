####Welcome to the Frost lab at the University of California, San Francisco

#####Work in our lab is connected by a common vision: to see the cell's macromolecules *get together and come to life*. We study biomolecular machines that are too delicate to purify to homogeneity, too large or too flexible to crystallize, or that depend upon lipids for their form or function. In order to derive unique insights into cell biology and disease, we integrate atomic structure determination by cryo-EM with genetics, biochemistry, and diverse imaging techniques. We work within the department of **[Biochemistry and Biophysics](http://biochemistry.ucsf.edu/)** and the **[Macromolecular Structure Group](http://www.msg.ucsf.edu/)** at **[UCSF](http://www.ucsf.edu/)**.
