#### Welcome to the Frost lab. We are affiliated with **[Altos Labs, Bay Area Institute of Science](https://altoslabs.com/)** and hold adjunct faculty appointments with the **[University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/biochemistry/)** and the **[University of California, San Francisco](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu/people/faculty)**

##### Our lab strives to see how macromolecules get together and come to life. We seek to understand how fuel-driven biological machines work--especially those that are too fragile to purify, too dynamic or flexible to crystallize, and that depend on lipids for their form and function. To derive unique insights into cell health, we integrate atomic structure determination by cryo-EM with genetics, biochemistry, and other electronic and photonic imaging techniques. The banner art on this page is a mesoscale model of living matter, inspired in part by some of our discoveries, by scientist and artist **[Said Sannuga](http://www.cellscape.co.uk)**.
