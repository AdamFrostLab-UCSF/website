#### Welcome to the **[Frost lab](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=QHQFeWwAAAAJ)**. We work for **[Altos Labs](https://altoslabs.com/)** within the **[Bay Area Institute of Science](https://altoslabs.com/team/principal-investigators-bay-area/adam-frost/)**. We are also affiliated with the **[Chan Zuckerberg Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/people/investigators/adam-frost-md-phd/)**, the **[University of Utah](https://medicine.utah.edu/biochemistry/)**, and the **[University of California, San Francisco](https://biophysics.ucsf.edu/people/faculty)**.

##### Our lab strives to see how molecules get together and come to life. We seek to understand how fuel-driven biological machines work, especially those too fragile to purify, too dynamic or flexible to crystallize, or that depend on lipids for their form and function. We integrate molecular structure determination by electron cryo-microscopy with genetics, biochemistry, and other imaging techniques to derive unique insights into cell health. The banner **[art](http://www.cellscape.co.uk)** depicts living matter inspired, in part, by our discoveries.
