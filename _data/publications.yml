    The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) mediate diverse membrane remodeling events. These typically require ESCRT-III proteins to stabilize negatively curved membranes; however, recent work has indicated that certain ESCRT-IIIs also participate in positive-curvature membrane-shaping reactions. ESCRT-IIIs polymerize into membrane-binding filaments, but the structural basis for negative versus positive membrane remodeling by these proteins remains poorly understood. To learn how certain ESCRT-IIIs shape positively curved membranes, we determined structures of human membrane-bound CHMP1B-only, membrane-bound CHMP1B + IST1, and IST1-only filaments by cryo-EM. Our structures show how CHMP1B first polymerizes into a single-stranded helical filament, shaping membranes into moderate-curvature tubules. Subsequently, IST1 assembles a second strand on CHMP1B, further constricting the membrane tube and reducing its diameter nearly to the fission point. Each step of constriction thins the underlying bilayer, lowering the barrier to membrane fission. Our structures reveal how a two-component, sequential polymerization mechanism drives membrane tubulation, constriction and bilayer thinning.

    Post-transcriptional ribosomal RNA (rRNA) modifications are present in all organisms, but their exact functional roles and positions are yet to be fully characterized. Modified nucleotides have been implicated in the stabilization of RNA structure and regulation of ribosome biogenesis and protein synthesis. In some instances, rRNA modifications can confer antibiotic resistance. High-resolution ribosome structures are thus necessary for precise determination of modified nucleotides' positions, a task that has previously been accomplished by X-ray crystallography. Here, we present a cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of the Escherichia coli 50S subunit at an average resolution of 2.2 Å as an additional approach for mapping modification sites. Our structure confirms known modifications present in 23S rRNA and additionally allows for localization of Mg2+ ions and their coordinated water molecules. Using our cryo-EM structure as a testbed, we developed a program for assessment of cryo-EM map quality. This program can be easily used on any RNA-containing cryo-EM structure, and an associated Coot plugin allows for visualization of validated modifications, making it highly accessible.

    The exocyst complex plays a critical role in determining both temporal and spatial dynamics of exocytic vesicle tethering and fusion with the plasma membrane. However, the mechanism by which the exocyst functions and how it is regulated remain poorly understood. Here we describe a novel biochemical assay for the examination of exocyst function in vesicle tethering. Importantly, the assay is stimulated by gain-of-function mutations in the Exo70 component of the exocyst, selected for their ability to bypass Rho/Cdc42 activation in vivo. Single-particle electron microscopy and 3D reconstructions of negatively stained exocyst complexes reveal a structural change in the mutant exocyst that exposes a binding site for the v-SNARE. We demonstrate a v-SNARE requirement in our tethering assay and increased v-SNARE binding to exocyst gain-of-function complexes. Together, these data suggest an allosteric mechanism for activation involving a conformational change in one subunit of the complex, which is relayed through the complex to regulate its biochemical activity in vitro, as well as overall function in vivo.

  abstract: |
    Although high-resolution single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is now producing a rapid stream of breakthroughs in structural biology, it nevertheless remains the case that the preparation of suitable frozen-hydrated samples on electron microscopy grids is often quite challenging. Purified samples that are intact and structurally homogeneous - while still in the test tube - may not necessarily survive the standard methods of making extremely thin, aqueous films on grids. As a result, it is often necessary to try a variety of experimental conditions before finally finding an approach that is optimal for the specimen at hand. Here, we summarize some of our collective experiences to date in optimizing sample preparation, in the hope that doing so will be useful to others, especially those new to the field. We also hope that an open discussion of these common challenges will encourage the development of more generally applicable methodology. Our collective experiences span a diverse range of biochemical samples and most of the commonly used variations in how grids are currently prepared. Unfortunately, none of the currently used optimization methods can be said, in advance, to be the one that ultimately will work when a project first begins. Nevertheless, there are some preferred first steps to explore when facing specific problems that can be more generally recommended, based on our experience and that of many others in the cryo-EM field.

  journal:  __Molecular Biology of the Cell__ 2019 August <br>
  abstract: |
    Cells have evolved diverse protein-based machinery to reshape, cut, or fuse their membrane-delimited compartments. Dynamin superfamily proteins are principal components of this machinery and use their ability to hydrolyze GTP and to polymerize into helices and rings to achieve these goals. Nucleotide-binding, hydrolysis, and exchange reactions drive significant conformational changes across the dynamin family, and these changes alter the shape and stability of supramolecular dynamin oligomers, as well as the ability of dynamins to bind receptors and membranes. Mutations that interfere with the conformational repertoire of these enzymes, and hence with membrane fission, exist in several inherited human diseases. Here, we discuss insights from new x-ray crystal structures and cryo-EM reconstructions that have enabled us to infer some of the allosteric dynamics for these proteins. Together, these studies help us to understand how dynamins perform mechanical work, as well as how specific mutants of dynamin family proteins exhibit pathogenic properties.

    Cellular membranes play host to a wide variety of morphologically and chemically complex processes. Although model membranes, like liposomes, are already widely used to reconstitute and study these processes, better tools are needed for making model bilayers that faithfully mimic cellular membranes. Existing methods for fabricating cell‐sized (µm) or organelle‐sized (tens to hundreds of nanometers) lipid vesicles have distinctly different requirements. Of particular note for biology, it remains challenging for any technique to efficiently encapsulate fragile cargo molecules or to generate liposomes with stable, asymmetric lipid leaflets within the bilayer. Here a tunable microfluidic device and protocol for fabricating liposomes with desired diameters ranging from ≈10 µm to ≈100 nm are described. Lipid vesicle size is templated by the simple inclusion of a polycarbonate filter within the microfluidic system and tuned with flow rate. It is shown that the vesicles made with this device are stable, unilamellar, lipid asymmetric, and capable of supporting transmembrane protein assembly, peripheral membrane protein binding, as well as soluble cargo encapsulation (including designer nanocages for biotechnology applications). These fabricated vesicles provide a new platform for studying the biophysically rich processes found within lipid–lipid and lipid–protein systems typically associated with cellular membranes.

  abstract: |
    The integrated stress response (ISR) tunes the rate of protein synthesis. Control is exerted by phosphorylation of the general translation initiation factor eIF2. eIF2 is a guanosine triphosphatase that becomes activated by eIF2B, a two-fold symmetric and heterodecameric complex that functions as eIF2's dedicated nucleotide exchange factor. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate into an inhibitor of eIF2B. We report cryo-electron microscopy structures of eIF2 bound to eIF2B in the dephosphorylated state. The structures reveal that the eIF2B decamer is a static platform upon which one or two flexible eIF2 trimers bind and align with eIF2B's bipartite catalytic centers to catalyze nucleotide exchange. Phosphorylation refolds eIF2α, allowing it to contact eIF2B at a different interface and, we surmise, thereby sequestering it into a nonproductive complex.

  abstract: |
    PGAM5 is a mitochondrial protein phosphatase whose genetic ablation in mice results in mitochondria-related disorders, including neurodegeneration. Functions of PGAM5 include regulation of mitophagy, cell death, metabolism and aging. However, mechanisms regulating PGAM5 activation and signaling are poorly understood. Using electron cryo-microscopy, we show that PGAM5 forms dodecamers in solution. We also present a crystal structure of PGAM5 that reveals the determinants of dodecamer formation. Furthermore, we observe PGAM5 dodecamer assembly into filaments both in vitro and in cells. We find that PGAM5 oligomerization into a dodecamer is not only essential for catalytic activation, but this form also plays a structural role on mitochondrial membranes, which is independent of phosphatase activity. Together, these findings suggest that modulation of the oligomerization of PGAM5 may be a regulatory switch of potential therapeutic interest.

  journal:  __Annual Reviews Cell Dev Bio__ 2018 September <br>
  abstract: |
    The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) pathway mediates cellular membrane remodeling and fission reactions. The pathway comprises five core complexes: ALIX, ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II, ESCRT-III, and Vps4. These soluble complexes are typically recruited to target membranes by site-specific adaptors that bind one or both of the early-acting ESCRT factors: ALIX and ESCRT-I/ESCRT-II. These factors, in turn, nucleate assembly of ESCRT-III subunits into membrane-bound filaments that recruit the AAA ATPase Vps4. Together, ESCRT-III filaments and Vps4 remodel and sever membranes. Here, we review recent advances in our understanding of the structures, activities, and mechanisms of the ESCRT-III and Vps4 machinery, including the first high-resolution structures of ESCRT-III filaments, the assembled Vps4 enzyme in complex with an ESCRT-III substrate, the discovery that ESCRT-III/Vps4 complexes can promote both inside-out and outside-in membrane fission reactions, and emerging mechanistic models for ESCRT-mediated membrane fission.

    Transparent surfaces within microfluidic devices are essential for accurate quantification of chemical, biological, and mechanical interactions. Here, we report how to create low-cost, rapid 3D-printed microfluidic devices that are optically free from artifacts and have transparent surfaces suitable for visualizing a variety of fluid phenomenon. The methodology described here can be used for creating high-pressure microfluidic systems (significantly higher than PDMS-glass bonding). We develop methods for annealing Poly-Lactic Acid (PLA) microfluidic devices demonstrating heat resistance typically not achievable with other plastic materials. We show DNA melting and subsequent fluorescent imaging analysis, opening the door to other high-temperature applications. The FDM techniques demonstrated here allow for fabrication of microfluidic devices for precise visualization of interfacial dynamics, whether mixing between two laminar streams or droplet tracking. In addition to these characterizations, we include a printer troubleshooting guide and printing recipes for device fabrication to facilitate FDM printing for microfluidic device development.

  journal:  __NATURE__ 2018 June <br>
  abstract: |
    Mitochondrial inheritance, genome maintenance and metabolic adaptation depend on organelle fission by dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and its mitochondrial receptors. DRP1 receptors include the paralogues mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kDa (MID49 and MID51) and mitochondrial fission factor (MFF); however, the mechanisms by which these proteins recruit and regulate DRP1 are unknown. Here we present a cryo-electron microscopy structure of full-length human DRP1 co-assembled with MID49 and an analysis of structure- and disease-based mutations. We report that GTP induces a marked elongation and rotation of the GTPase domain, bundle-signalling element and connecting hinge loops of DRP1. In this conformation, a network of multivalent interactions promotes the polymerization of a linear DRP1 filament with MID49 or MID51. After co-assembly, GTP hydrolysis and exchange lead to MID receptor dissociation, filament shortening and curling of DRP1 oligomers into constricted and closed rings. Together, these views of full-length, receptor- and nucleotide-bound conformations reveal how DRP1 performs mechanical work through nucleotide-driven allostery.

    Eukaryotic cells employ the ribosome-associated quality control complex (RQC) to maintain homeostasis despite defects that cause ribosomes to stall. The RQC comprises the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p, the ATPase Cdc48p, Rqc1p, and Rqc2p. Upon ribosome stalling and splitting, the RQC assembles on the 60S species containing unreleased peptidyl-tRNA (60S:peptidyl–tRNA). Ltn1p and Rqc1p facilitate ubiquitination of the incomplete nascent chain, marking it for degradation. Rqc2p stabilizes Ltn1p on the 60S and recruits charged tRNAs to the 60S to catalyze elongation of the nascent protein with carboxy-terminal alanine and threonine extensions (CAT tails). By mobilizing the nascent chain, CAT tailing can expose lysine residues that are hidden in the exit tunnel, thereby supporting efficient ubiquitination. If the ubiquitin–proteasome system is overwhelmed or unavailable, CAT-tailed nascent chains can aggregate in the cytosol or within organelles like mitochondria. Here we identify Vms1p as a tRNA hydrolase that releases stalled polypeptides engaged by the RQC.

    The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) supports biosynthesis of proteins with diverse transmembrane domain (TMD) lengths and hydrophobicity. Features in transmembrane domains such as charged residues in ion channels are often functionally important, but could pose a challenge during cotranslational membrane insertion and folding. Our systematic proteomic approaches in both yeast and human cells revealed that the ER membrane protein complex (EMC) binds to and promotes the biogenesis of a range of multipass transmembrane proteins, with a particular enrichment for transporters. Proximity-specific ribosome profiling demonstrates that the EMC engages clients cotranslationally and immediately following clusters of TMDs enriched for charged residues. The EMC can remain associated after completion of translation, which both protects clients from premature degradation and allows recruitment of substrate-specific and general chaperones. Thus, the EMC broadly enables the biogenesis of multipass transmembrane proteins containing destabilizing features, thereby mitigating the trade-off between function and stability.

    Regulation by the integrated stress response (ISR) converges on the phosphorylation of translation initiation factor eIF2 in response to a variety of stresses. Phosphorylation converts eIF2 from a substrate to a competitive inhibitor of its dedicated guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, thereby inhibiting translation. ISRIB, a drug-like eIF2B activator, reverses the effects of eIF2 phosphorylation, and in rodents it enhances cognition and corrects cognitive deficits after brain injury. To determine its mechanism of action, we solved an atomic-resolution structure of ISRIB bound in a deep cleft within decameric human eIF2B by cryo–electron microscopy. Formation of fully active, decameric eIF2B holoenzyme depended on the assembly of two identical tetrameric subcomplexes, and ISRIB promoted this step by cross-bridging a central symmetry interface. Thus, regulation of eIF2B assembly emerges as a rheostat for eIF2B activity that tunes translation during the ISR and that can be further modulated by ISRIB.

  abstract: |
    Dynamin, which mediates membrane fission during endocytosis, binds endophilin and other members of the Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs (BAR) protein family. How endophilin influences endocytic membrane fission is still unclear. Here we show that dynamin-mediated membrane fission is potently inhibited in vitro when an excess of endophilin co-assembles with dynamin around membrane tubules. We further show by electron microscopy that endophilin intercalates between turns of the dynamin helix and impairs fission by preventing trans interactions between dynamin rungs that are thought to play critical roles in membrane constriction. In living cells, overexpression of endophilin delayed both fission and transferrin uptake. Together, our observations suggest that while endophilin helps shape endocytic tubules and recruit dynamin to endocytic sites, it can also block membrane fission when present in excess by inhibiting inter-dynamin interactions. The sequence of recruitment and the relative stoichiometry of the two proteins may be critical to regulated endocytic fission.

    Ribosomes can stall during translation due to defects in the mRNA template or translation machinery, leading to the production of incomplete proteins. The Ribosome-associated Quality control Complex (RQC) engages stalled ribosomes and targets nascent polypeptides for proteasomal degradation. However, how each RQC component contributes to this process remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that key RQC activities-Ltn1p-dependent ubiquitination and Rqc2p-mediated Carboxy-terminal Alanine and Threonine (CAT) tail elongation-can be recapitulated in vitro with a yeast cell-free system. Using this approach, we determined that CAT tailing is mechanistically distinct from canonical translation, that Ltn1p-mediated ubiquitination depends on the poorly characterized RQC component Rqc1p, and that the process of CAT tailing enables robust ubiquitination of the nascent polypeptide. These findings establish a novel system to study the RQC and provide a framework for understanding how RQC factors coordinate their activities to facilitate clearance of incompletely synthesized proteins.

  journal:  __SCIENCE__ 2017 Jul
  abstract: |
    Ribosome stalling leads to recruitment of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC), which targets the partially synthesized polypeptide for proteasomal degradation through the action of the ubiquitin ligase Ltn1p. A second core RQC component, Rqc2p, modifies the nascent polypeptide by adding a carboxyl-terminal alanine and threonine (CAT) tail through a noncanonical elongation reaction. Here we examined the role of CAT-tailing in nascent-chain degradation in budding yeast. We found that Ltn1p efficiently accessed only nascent-chain lysines immediately proximal to the ribosome exit tunnel. For substrates without Ltn1p-accessible lysines, CAT-tailing enabled degradation by exposing lysines sequestered in the ribosome exit tunnel. Thus, CAT-tails do not serve as a degron, but rather provide a fail-safe mechanism that expands the range of RQC-degradable substrates.

  abstract: |
    Endosomal sorting complexes required for transport III (ESCRT-III) proteins have been implicated in sealing the nuclear envelope in mammals, spindle pole body dynamics in fission yeast, and surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes in budding yeast. Here, we report that Lem2p (LEM2), a member of the LEM (Lap2-Emerin-Man1) family of inner nuclear membrane proteins, and the ESCRT-II/ESCRT-III hybrid protein Cmp7p (CHMP7), work together to recruit additional ESCRT-III proteins to holes in the nuclear membrane. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe, deletion of the ATPase vps4 leads to severe defects in nuclear morphology and integrity. These phenotypes are suppressed by loss-of-function mutations that arise spontaneously in lem2 or cmp7, implying that these proteins may function upstream in the same pathway. Building on these genetic interactions, we explored the role of LEM2 during nuclear envelope reformation in human cells. We found that CHMP7 and LEM2 enrich at the same region of the chromatin disk periphery during this window of cell division and that CHMP7 can bind directly to the C-terminal domain of LEM2 in vitro. We further found that, during nuclear envelope formation, recruitment of the ESCRT factors CHMP7, CHMP2A, and IST1/CHMP8 all depend on LEM2 in human cells. We conclude that Lem2p/LEM2 is a conserved nuclear site-specific adaptor that recruits Cmp7p/CHMP7 and downstream ESCRT factors to the nuclear envelope.

    The large GTPase dynamin is the first protein shown to catalyze membrane fission. Dynamin and its related proteins are essential to many cell functions, from endocytosis to organelle division and fusion, and it plays a critical role in many physiological functions such as synaptic transmission and muscle contraction. Research of the past three decades has focused on understanding how dynamin works. In this review, we present the basis for an emerging consensus on how dynamin functions. Three properties of dynamin are strongly supported by experimental data: first, dynamin oligomerizes into a helical polymer; second, dynamin oligomer constricts in the presence of GTP; and third, dynamin catalyzes membrane fission upon GTP hydrolysis. We present the two current models for fission, essentially diverging in how GTP energy is spent. We further discuss how future research might solve the remaining open questions presently under discussion.

- title: A Golgi rhomboid protease Rbd2 recruits Cdc48 to cleave yeast SREBP
  authors: |

  journal: __EMBO J__ 2016 Nov
  abstract: |
    Hypoxic growth of fungi requires sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors, and human opportunistic fungal pathogens require SREBP activation for virulence. Proteolytic release of fission yeast SREBPs from the membrane in response to low oxygen requires the Golgi membrane-anchored Dsc E3 ligase complex. Using genetic interaction arrays, we identified Rbd2 as a rhomboid family protease required for SREBP proteolytic processing. Rbd2 is an active, Golgi-localized protease that cleaves the transmembrane segment of the TatA rhomboid model substrate. Epistasis analysis revealed that the Dsc E3 ligase acts on SREBP prior to cleavage by Rbd2. Using APEX2 proximity biotinylation, we demonstrated that Rbd2 binds the AAA-ATPase Cdc48 through a C-terminal SHP box. Interestingly, SREBP cleavage required Rbd2 binding of Cdc48, consistent with Cdc48 acting to recruit ubiquitinylated substrates. In support of this claim, overexpressing a Cdc48-binding mutant of Rbd2 bypassed the Cdc48 requirement for SREBP cleavage, demonstrating that Cdc48 likely plays a role in SREBP recognition. In the absence of functional Rbd2, SREBP precursor is degraded by the proteasome, indicating that Rbd2 activity controls the balance between SREBP activation and degradation.

  abstract: |
    The exocyst is a hetero-octameric complex that has been proposed to serve 
    as the tethering complex for exocytosis, although it remains poorly 
    understood at the molecular level. Here, we purified endogenous exocyst 
    complexes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and showed that they are stable 
    and consist of all eight subunits with equal stoichiometry. Using a 
    combination of biochemical and auxin induced-degradation experiments in 
    yeast, we mapped the subunit connectivity, identified two stable four-
    subunit modules within the octamer and demonstrated that several known 
    exocyst-binding partners are not necessary for exocyst assembly and 
    stability. Furthermore, we visualized the structure of the yeast complex 
    by using negative-stain electron microscopy; our results indicate that the 
    exocyst exists predominantly as a stable, octameric complex with an 
    elongated architecture that suggests that the subunits are contiguous 
    helical bundles packed together into a bundle of long rods.

    The endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRT) proteins 
    mediate fundamental membrane remodeling events that require stabilizing 
    negative membrane curvature. These include endosomal intralumenal vesicle 
    formation, HIV budding, nuclear envelope closure, and cytokinetic 
    abscission. ESCRT-III subunits perform key roles in these processes by 
    changing conformation and polymerizing into membrane-remodeling filaments. 
    Here, we report the 4 angstrom resolution cryogenic electron microscopy 
    reconstruction of a one-start, double-stranded helical copolymer composed 
    of two different human ESCRT-III subunits, charged multivesicular body 
    protein 1B (CHMP1B) and increased sodium tolerance 1 (IST1). The inner 
    strand comprises "open" CHMP1B subunits that interlock in an elaborate 
    domain-swapped architecture and is encircled by an outer strand of 
    "closed" IST1 subunits. Unlike other ESCRT-III proteins, CHMP1B and IST1 
    polymers form external coats on positively curved membranes in vitro and 
    in vivo. Our analysis suggests how common ESCRT-III filament architectures 
    could stabilize different degrees and directions of membrane curvature.

    In Eukarya, stalled translation induces 40S dissociation and recruitment 
    of the ribosome quality control complex (RQC) to the 60S subunit, which 
    mediates nascent chain degradation. Here we report cryo-electron 
    microscopy structures revealing that the RQC components Rqc2p (YPL009C/
    Tae2) and Ltn1p (YMR247C/Rkr1) bind to the 60S subunit at sites exposed 
    after 40S dissociation, placing the Ltn1p RING (Really Interesting New 
    Gene) domain near the exit channel and Rqc2p over the P-site transfer RNA (
    tRNA). We further demonstrate that Rqc2p recruits alanine- and threonine-
    charged tRNA to the A site and directs the elongation of nascent chains 
    independently of mRNA or 40S subunits. Our work uncovers an unexpected 
    mechanism of protein synthesis, in which a protein--not an 
    mRNA--determines tRNA recruitment and the tagging of nascent chains with 
    carboxy-terminal Ala and Thr extensions (\"CAT tails\").

  abstract: |
    Mitochondrial fission is mediated by the dynamin-related GTPases Dnm1/Drp1 
    (yeast/mammals), which form spirals around constricted sites on 
    mitochondria. Additional membrane-associated adaptor proteins (Fis1, Mdv1, 
    Mff, and MiDs) are required to recruit these GTPases from the cytoplasm to 
    the mitochondrial surface. Whether these adaptors participate in both 
    GTPase recruitment and membrane scission is not known. Here we use a yeast 
    strain lacking all fission proteins to identify the minimal combinations 
    of GTPases and adaptors sufficient for mitochondrial fission. Although 
    Fis1 is dispensable for fission, membrane-anchored Mdv1, Mff, or MiDs 
    paired individually with their respective GTPases are sufficient to divide 
    mitochondria. In addition to their role in Drp1 membrane recruitment, MiDs 
    coassemble with Drp1 in vitro. The resulting heteropolymer adopts a 
    dramatically different structure with a narrower diameter than Drp1 
    homopolymers assembled in isolation. This result demonstrates that an 
    adaptor protein alters the architecture of a mitochondrial dynamin GTPase 
    polymer in a manner that could facilitate membrane constriction and 
    severing activity.

    The conserved transcriptional regulator heat shock factor 1 (Hsf1) is a 
    key sensor of proteotoxic and other stress in the eukaryotic cytosol. We 
    surveyed Hsf1 activity in a genome-wide loss-of-function library in 
    Saccaromyces cerevisiae as well as ~78,000 double mutants and found Hsf1 
    activity to be modulated by highly diverse stresses. These included 
    disruption of a ribosome-bound complex we named the Ribosome Quality 
    Control Complex (RQC) comprising the Ltn1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, two highly 
    conserved but poorly characterized proteins (Tae2 and Rqc1), and Cdc48 and 
    its cofactors. Electron microscopy and biochemical analyses revealed that 
    the RQC forms a stable complex with 60S ribosomal subunits containing 
    stalled polypeptides and triggers their degradation. A negative feedback 
    loop regulates the RQC, and Hsf1 senses an RQC-mediated translation-stress 
    signal distinctly from other stresses. Our work reveals the range of 
    stresses Hsf1 monitors and elucidates a conserved cotranslational protein 
    quality control mechanism.

    We present a genetic interaction map of pairwise measures including ∼40%

    identified an important subset of orthologous complexes that have 
    undergone functional \"repurposing\": the evolution of divergent functions 
    and partnerships. We validated three functional repurposing events in S. 
    pombe and mammalian cells and discovered that (1) two lumenal sensors of 
    misfolded ER proteins, the kinase/nuclease Ire1 and the 
    glucosyltransferase Gpt1, act together to mount an ER stress response; (2) 
    ESCRT factors regulate spindle-pole-body duplication; and (3) a membrane-
    protein phosphatase and kinase complex, the STRIPAK complex, bridges the 
    cis-Golgi, the centrosome, and the outer nuclear membrane to direct 
    mitotic progression. Each discovery opens new areas of inquiry and-together

  journal: __CELL__ 2012 Mar
  abstract: |
    Functioning as key players in cellular regulation of membrane curvature, 
    BAR domain proteins bend bilayers and recruit interaction partners through 
    poorly understood mechanisms. Using electron cryomicroscopy, we present 
    reconstructions of full-length endophilin and its N-terminal N-BAR domain 
    in their membrane-bound state. Endophilin lattices expose large areas of 
    membrane surface and are held together by promiscuous interactions between 
    endophilin's amphipathic N-terminal helices. Coarse-grained molecular 
    dynamics simulations reveal that endophilin lattices are highly dynamic 
    and that the N-terminal helices are required for formation of a stable and 
    regular scaffold. Furthermore, endophilin accommodates different 
    curvatures through a quantized addition or removal of endophilin dimers, 
    which in some cases causes dimerization of endophilin's SH3 domains, 
    suggesting that the spatial presentation of SH3 domains, rather than 
    affinity, governs the recruitment of downstream interaction partners.

  abstract: |
    During brain development, proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis is 
    critical for the establishment of functional neural circuits. Here we 
    report that srGAP2 negatively regulates neuronal migration and induces 
    neurite outgrowth and branching through the ability of its F-BAR domain to 
    induce filopodia-like membrane protrusions resembling those induced by 
    I-BAR domains in vivo and in vitro. Previous work has suggested that in 
    nonneuronal cells filopodia dynamics decrease the rate of cell migration 
    and the persistence of leading edge protrusions. srGAP2 knockdown reduces 
    leading process branching and increases the rate of neuronal migration in 
    vivo. Overexpression of srGAP2 or its F-BAR domain has the opposite 
    effects, increasing leading process branching and decreasing migration. 
    These results suggest that F-BAR domains are functionally diverse and 
    highlight the functional importance of proteins directly regulating 
    membrane deformation for proper neuronal migration and morphogenesis.

  journal: __CELL__ 2008 Mar
  abstract: |
    BAR superfamily domains shape membranes through poorly understood 
    mechanisms. We solved structures of F-BAR modules bound to flat and curved 
    bilayers using electron (cryo)microscopy. We show that membrane tubules 
    form when F-BARs polymerize into helical coats that are held together by 
    lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. On gel-state membranes or after 
    mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb 
    onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that 
    membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition 
    of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend 
    locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface 
    through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly 
    of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric 
    constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how 
    F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and 
    provide insight into the spatial regulation of membrane invagination.

- title: GTP-dependent twisting of dynamin implicates constriction and tension in membrane fission
  authors: |
    Roux A, Uyhazi K, Frost A, De Camilli P
  journal: __NATURE__ 2006 Apr
  abstract: |
    Dynamin, a crucial factor in endocytosis, is a member of a family of 
    GTPases that participates in membrane fission. It was initially proposed 
    to act as a machine that constricts and cuts the neck of nascent vesicles 
    in a GTP-hydrolysis-dependent reaction, but subsequent studies suggested 
    alternative models. Here we monitored the effect of nucleotides on 
    dynamin-coated lipid tubules in real time. Addition of GTP, but not of GDP 
    or GTP-gammaS, resulted in twisting of the tubules and supercoiling, 
    suggesting a rotatory movement of the helix turns relative to each other 
    during GTP hydrolysis. Rotation was confirmed by the movement of beads 
    attached to the tubules. Twisting activity produced a longitudinal tension 
    that was released by tubule breakage when both ends of the tubule were 
    anchored. Fission also occurred when dynamin and GTP were added to lipid 
    tubules that had been generated from liposomes by the motor activity of 
    kinesin on microtubules. No fission events were observed in the absence of 
    longitudinal tension. These findings demonstrate a mechanoenzyme activity 
    of dynamin in endocytosis, but also imply that constriction is not 
    sufficient for fission. At the short necks of endocytic vesicles, other 
    factors leading to tension may cooperate with the constricting activity of 
    dynamin to induce fission.
