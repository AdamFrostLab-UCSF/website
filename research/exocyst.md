##Project Overview:
A fundamental hallmark of eukaryotic cells is their organization into functionally distinct, membrane bound
compartments, which communicate with each other through vesicle trafficking. Integral to this organization are
mechanisms that mediate vesicle tethering and fusion with target compartments. The **[exocyst complex ](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22420621)** has a
fundamental, conserved role in tethering and fusion of secretory vesicles at the plasma membrane. Despite its
importance, major aspects of exocyst function are completely unknown. Our exciting preliminary and recently
published data provides compelling support to our hypothesis that exocyst functions in two fundamental ways
to spatially and temporally control localization of specific membrane fusion events: a) tethering/recognition of
the correct vesicle and site(s) on the target membrane (generally the plasma membrane); and b) stimulation
and/or stabilization of proper SNARE complex assembly, in cooperation with the SNARE regulator Sec1.
Elucidation of the molecular underpinnings of exocyst structure and function will dramatically improve our
understanding of how the specificity and timing of vesicle targeting and fusion is controlled. We will test these
functional hypotheses through our powerful use of biochemical/biophysical/structural studies combined with
yeast genetic and cell biology methods. The conservation of the complex will enable us to extrapolate from the
yeast model system to not only understanding exocyst function in all eukaryotes, but also the function of
structurally related multi-subunit tethering complexes which operate at other stages in the secretory pathway.
