##Project Overview:
Neurodegeneration occurs in many different diseases, but the causal mechanisms that lead to neuron death are generally unknown. New mouse models of neurodegeneration have been described that cannot be explained by any of the known mechanisms implicated in neuropathology. Recent work in our lab and the labs of our collaborators has begun illuminating the molecular basis of disease in these mice. The defects appear to involve an unforeseen mechanism of protein quality control centered on the Ribosome Quality Control Complex or **[RQC](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23178123)**. Exploration of this pathway led us to discover a novel quality control mechanism in eukaryotic cells: incomplete protein products—stalled nascent chains that result when the ribosome fails to complete translation—are elongated with a specific “tail” of alanine and threonine residues and this tail is synthesized without mRNA and without the small subunit of the ribosome. This C-terminal Ala and Thr tail or **[CAT tail](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25554787)** impacts the degradation of incomplete proteins and the induction of stress responses. This is a man-bites-dog(ma) kind of surprise; we propose to determine the impact of CAT tails on protein stability, stress signaling and neurodegeneration in mice.
