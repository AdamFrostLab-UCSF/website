##Structure and Function of srGAP Proteins

##Project Overview
The migration of neurons determines the structure and connectivity of the nervous system. During this process, the leading edges of migrating neurons are re-shaped continuously as a concert of extracellular and intracellular signals transduce information to cytoskeleton and membrane-remodeling proteins. Defects in this process have been implicated directly in human disorders of sensation, cognition and motor skills.  The **[srGAP](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19737524)** family of proteins regulates the migration and morphology of neurons by coupling and coordinating remodeling reactions of the neuronal membrane and the cytoskeleton in response to several stimuli from neighboring cells in developing neural networks. It was discovered recently that some srGAP isoforms are unique to humans and have played a major role in evolution of the large and highly evolved human neocortex, while others appear to be dysregulated in human patients suffering from schizophrenia. Despite such fundamental importance, we do not have a clear mechanistic understanding of srGAPâ€™s remarkable properties. We propose to determine the biochemical and structural properties of srGAP proteins versus srGAPs implicated in human evolution and disease. We will address this challenge using cutting-edge biochemical and biophysical methods. Successful conclusion of this research will shed light on the fundamental roles that srGAPs play during human development and disease and willreveal the molecular roots of diseases attributable to srGAP mutations.
