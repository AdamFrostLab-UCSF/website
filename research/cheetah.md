##Molecular Mechanisms of Membrane Remodeling by the ESCRT-III Pathway

-------
Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport (ESCRT) reshape and scission membranes in diverse contexts: cell division, virus budding, and membrane-protein degradation at the endosome. The late-acting ESCRT-III complex and an ATPase, VPS4, function in each of these processes and are responsible for the membrane shaping and severing reactions. Human ESCRT-III complexes are polymers composed of Charged Multi-Vesicular Protein (CHMP) subunits, but the mechanism(s) by which these polymers drive membrane deformation and scission remain unknown. In the period of this grant, my lab will solve two key problems concerning ESCRT-driven membrane remodeling. We will 1) solve high resolution 3D reconstructions of a physiological ESCRT-III hetero-polymer using electron cryo-microscopy to determine the mechanism(s) of activation and assembly; 2) we will generate well-ordered samples of membrane-bound ESCRT-III polymers and analysis tools to determine the mechanisms governing membrane 
binding and deformation. Completion of these aims will position to determine near atomic-scale models of ESCRT-driven membrane remodeling and fission reactions.
