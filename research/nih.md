##Project Overview:

The overarching goal of this research program is to understand the structures and functions of machines 
that assemble on cellular membranes. Cells constantly transform the shape, size and connectivity of their 
membranes and this remodeling underlies cell division, migration, differentiation, and communication. 
In addition, every pathogen hijacks or disrupts membrane-associated complexes to infect or escape from 
host cells. Despite this fundamental importance we lack a detailed view of how membrane-binding proteins 
transduce signals, oligomerize, and remodel the size, shape or topology of cellular membranes. Our 
limited knowledge stems from the inherent problems in studying multi-component complexes that assemble 
on phospholipid bilayers.

##Objectives:
To overcome these challenges, we will develop genetic, biochemical and structural methods to discover 
and characterize membrane-associated machines in molecular detail and to learn how they function within 
cellular pathways. We are 1) building genome-wide genetic interaction maps to identify multi-component 
complexes and to annotate their functions, and 2) leveraging advances in cryo-electron microscopy 
(cryoEM) and image analysis to resolve the structures of these machines in their native, membrane-
associated states. These two arms of our research are distinct technologically but mutually reinforcing: 
genetic studies define functional complexes for in vitro investigation and then, when we solve a 
molecular structure by cryoEM, we test the functional predictions of our model with loss-of-function 
phenotypes and genetic interaction assays in vivo. These orthogonal methods provide synergistic 
observations of the molecular mechanisms that underlie cellular functions. <br/><br/>
