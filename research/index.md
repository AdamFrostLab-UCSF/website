In one of my favorite science fables, Sydney Brenner supposedly opened a seminar at the LMB by saying; “I think we can all agree that structural biology is UN-interesting; that hydrogen bonds and beta-pleated sheets are boring.” I tell my new students and post-docs this legend whenever we sit down to discuss what they want to explore following the Resolution Revolution in cryo-EM. You can now determine atomic-resolution structures of anything you want to, I tell them, but we didn’t come here to collect structures."
