We can now determine or compute the atomic-resolution structure of almost anything, but we didn’t come here to collect structures. **[“Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees”](https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Forgetting-Name-Thing-Sees/dp/0520049209/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=X1XJJQ0FF6GRVDMQ638H)** and our projects start with this optimism: structural biology is discovery biology. Our efforts to resolve life’s machinery will teach us how living matter works and, with some luck, will shed light on how living molecules emerged.<br>

The Frost lab primarily studies how lipids and proteins coassembly to govern the forms and functions of intracellular structures. Using biochemistry, light and electron microscopy, we dissect the mechanisms that shape the nuclear envelope and the mitochondria, among other organelles. We also seek to understand the control mechanisms that link organelle homeostasis with proteostasis. In this second field, we study how organelles modulate new protein synthesis by the ribosome. Collaborativey, we determined the structural basis of the Integrated Stress Response (ISR) and aspects of the Ribosome-associated Quality Control (RQC) pathway.<br>

Our sources of research support are listed below in chronological order, starting with our lab’s opening in 2011. We wouldn’t be here without these funders and the vision they share with **[Mary Lasker](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mary_Lasker)** (“If you think research is expensive, try disease”). The diversity in our sources of support and the range of questions we investigate is part design, part serendipity. Our lab believes in **[edge effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effects)**: or evolved innovation within ecosystems adapted to the overlap between two or more habitats.
