In one of my favorite science fables, Sydney Brenner supposedly opened a seminar at the LMB by saying: I think we can all agree that structural biology is boring. Yet another hydrogen bond or beta-pleated sheet?. I tell new students and post-docs this legend whenever we sit down to discuss where they want to explore following the Resolution Revolution in cryo-EM. You can now determine atomic structures of anything you want to, I tell them, but we didnâ€™t come here to collect structures. Or as George Palade is rumored to have said to his trainees: many things are interesting, precious few are important.
