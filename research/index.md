In one of my favorite science fables, **[Sydney Brenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Brenner)** supposedly opened a seminar that was meant to be a celebration of structural biology at the **[storied LMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_of_Molecular_Biology)** by saying: 'I think we can all agree that hydrogen bonds and beta-pleated sheets are boring'. I tell new students and post-docs this legend when we discuss where they want to explore following the **[Resolution Revolution](http://www.nature.com/news/the-revolution-will-not-be-crystallized-a-new-method-sweeps-through-structural-biology-1.18335)** in cryo-EM. You can now determine the atomic structure of just about anything you can purify, but we didnâ€™t come here to collect structures. The diversity of projects in our lab share an optimism that structural biology can and should be discovery biology, that our efforts to see biological molecules directly will teach us how living matter works.
