Our first field of inquiry concerns mechanisms that govern the shape, connectivity, and topology of organelles. We study how lipids and proteins work in concert to determine the forms and functions of biomembranes. We also seek to understand the homeostatic control mechanisms linking organellostasis with proteostasis. In this second field, we study how cells regulate protein synthesis from initiation to whether they complete translation normally or degrade nascent proteins that fail quality control.<br>

Our sources of reserach support are listed below in chronological order, starting with the lab's opening in 2011. We wouldn’t be here without these funders and the vision they share with **[Mary Lasker](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Mary_Lasker)** (“If you think research is expensive, try disease”). The diversity in our sources of support and the range of questions we are investigating is part design, part serendipity. Our lab believes in **[edge effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_effects)**: evolved innovation within ecosystems that have adapted to the overlap between two or more habitats.
