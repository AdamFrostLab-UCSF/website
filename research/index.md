In one of my favorite science fables, **[Sydney Brenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Brenner)** supposedly opened a seminar at the LMB--the birthplace of structural biology--by saying: 'I think we can all agree that hydrogen bonds and beta-pleated sheets are boring'. I tell new students and post-docs this legend whenever we sit down to discuss what they want to explore following the Resolution Revolution in cryo-EM. You can now determine atomic structures of anything you want to, but we didnâ€™t come here to collect structures. Or as George Palade is rumored to have said to his trainees: many things are interesting, few are important.
