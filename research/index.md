In one of my favorite science fables, **[Sydney Brenner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Brenner)** supposedly opened a seminar that was meant to be a celebration of structural biology at the **[storied LMB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_of_Molecular_Biology)** by saying: 'I think we can all agree that hydrogen bonds and beta-pleated sheets are boring'. I tell new students and post-docs this legend when we discuss where they want to explore following the **[Resolution Revolution](http://www.nature.com/news/the-revolution-will-not-be-crystallized-a-new-method-sweeps-through-structural-biology-1.18335)** in cryoEM. We can now determine the atomic structure of just about anything, but we didnâ€™t come here to collect structures. **["Seeing is Forgetting the Name of the Thing One Sees"](https://www.amazon.com/Seeing-Forgetting-Name-Thing-Sees/dp/0520049209/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=X1XJJQ0FF6GRVDMQ638H)** -- each of our projects started with this optimism: that structural biology is discovery biology. Our efforts to see the cell's machinery directly will teach us how living matter works.
