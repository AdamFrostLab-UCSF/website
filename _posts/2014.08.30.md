##Project Description and Overview:

The overarching goal of this research program is to understand the structures and functions of machines 
that assemble on cellular membranes. Cells constantly transform the shape, size and connectivity of their 
membranes and this remodeling underlies cell division, migration, differentiation, and communication. 
In addition, every pathogen hijacks or disrupts membrane-associated complexes to infect or escape from 
host cells. Despite this fundamental importance we lack a detailed view of how membrane-binding proteins 
transduce signals, oligomerize, and remodel the size, shape or topology of cellular membranes. Our 
limited knowledge stems from the inherent problems in studying multi-component complexes that assemble 
on phospholipid bilayers.
